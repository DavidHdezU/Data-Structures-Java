When you press me to your heart
When you press me to your heart
When you press me to your heart
When you kiss me, Heaven sighs
When you kiss me, Heaven sighs
When you kiss me, Heaven sighs
This is la vie en rose
This is la vie en rose
This is la vie en rose
The magic spell you cast
The magic spell you cast
The magic spell you cast
Seems to turn into love songs
Seems to turn into love songs
Seems to turn into love songs
La vie en rose
La vie en rose
La vie en rose
I see la vie en rose
I see la vie en rose
I see la vie en rose
Hold me close and hold me fast
Hold me close and hold me fast
Hold me close and hold me fast
Give your heart and soul to me
Give your heart and soul to me
Give your heart and soul to me
Every day words
Every day words
Every day words
A world where roses bloom
A world where roses bloom
A world where roses bloom
Angels sing from above
Angels sing from above
Angels sing from above
And when you speak
And when you speak
And when you speak
And though I close my eyes
And though I close my eyes
And though I close my eyes
And life will always be
And life will always be
And life will always be
And in a world apart
And in a world apart
And in a world apart
