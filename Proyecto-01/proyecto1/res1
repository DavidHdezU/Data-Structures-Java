A world where roses bloom
And in a world apart
And life will always be
And though I close my eyes
And when you speak
Angels sing from above
Every day words
Give your heart and soul to me
Hold me close and hold me fast
I see la vie en rose
La vie en rose
Seems to turn into love songs
The magic spell you cast
This is la vie en rose
When you kiss me, Heaven sighs
When you press me to your heart
